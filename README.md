# WeatherMapComparison

The purpose of this project is to take what I have learned through a few take-home assignments, Leaflet and Vue.js, and apply to an application.

Two maps are displayed side-by-side where the user can select one "home" location and a "away" location to compare the weather at both. This was also inspired by the "polar-vortex"  event in early 2019 whereas the Midwest and East were getting hit with very cold temperatures while here in Colorado it was relatively mild.
