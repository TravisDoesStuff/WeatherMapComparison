# Cloud2Ground

The purpose of this project is to take what I have learned through a few take-home assignments, Leaflet and Vue.js, and apply to an application.

Two maps are displayed side-by-side where the user can select a "home" location and an "away" location to compare the weather between them. This was also inspired by the "bomb-cyclone" event in early 2019 where the Midwest and East were hit with frigid temperatures while home in Colorado was relatively mild.

Some additional statistics have been or will be added in the future include climate data, daylight hours, alerts, and geographical information.
