# WeatherMapComparison

The purpose of this project is to take what I have learned through a few take-home assignments, Leaflet and Vue.js, and apply to an application.

Two maps are displayed side-by-side where the user can select one "home" location and a "away" location to compare the weather at both. This was also inspired by the "polar-vortex" event in early 2019 whereas the Midwest and East were getting hit with very cold temperatures while here in Colorado it was relatively mild.

Some additional statistics have been or will be added in the future include climate data, daylight hours, alerts, and geographical information.
